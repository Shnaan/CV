<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Software Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and over 10 years of experience working with <strong>enterprise, database-driven systems</strong> , IT operations, and application development. Holds a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science, both evaluated as equivalent to U.S. degrees by WES.

<p>My early career focused on <strong>Oracle-based client-server systems</strong> , where I worked across database design, business logic, and application workflows for institutional and organizational use. I contributed to secure transaction mechanisms, internal enterprise applications, and data-centric systems that emphasized correctness, reliability, and long-term maintainability.</p>

<p>I am currently transitioning into <strong>modern frontend and software developmen</strong> , focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with an emphasis on building applications <strong> from scratch</strong>, strengthening core fundamentals, and aligning with current industry practices. Now based in the U.S., I bring mature engineering judgment, disciplined problem-solving, and renewed hands-on focus toward junior frontend or software engineering roles.
